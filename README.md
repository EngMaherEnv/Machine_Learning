# NLP_&_Machine_Learning_Projects
In this repo I add some of my ML AND NLP projects.



### 1- Bert Sentiment Analysis project :

  Make use of the BERT most powerful Google Deep Learinig NLP model (built above transformers ) to do Turkish News Sentiment Analysis.
  This BERT model here is used for transfer Learning and It has been finely tuned to our Data.
  The News will be classifed to either Positive or Negative News.
