 2- Text To Video project: 
 
   This prototype project aims to create a video from just text,The steps are:
  - Divide an article into several sentences.
  - Text-to-speech: The program reads each sentence and saves an audio file for it.
  - The program will also extract keywords for each sentence.
  - The program will search Google Images for these keywords and download the relevant images.
  - Then it compains all audio files using their images and creates an MP4 video.
   Note: This envolves NLP , webscraping , video genrating ...etc

3- Bert Sentiment Analysis:

  Make use of the BERT most powerful Google Deep Learinig NLP model (built above transformers ) to do Turkish News Sentiment Analysis.
  This BERT model here is used for transfer Learning and It has been finely tuned to our Data.
  The News will be classifed to either Positive or Negative News.
