In this repo I add some of my ML projects.

1-FastText News Category Classification:
  I used Facebook's popular FastText NLP model to categorize Turkish news into many categories such as sports, economics, and politics.

 2- Text To Video: 
   This prototype project aims to create a video from just text,The steps are:
  - Divide an article into several sentences.
  - Text-to-speech: The program reads each sentence and saves an audio file for it.
  - The program will also extract keywords for each sentence.
  - The program will search Google Images for these keywords and download the relevant images.
  - Then it compains all audio files using their images and creates an MP4 video.
   Note: This envolves NLP , webscraping , video genrating ...etc
